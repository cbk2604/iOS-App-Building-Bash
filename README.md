# iOS-App-Building-Bash
Building an iOS App Without Xcode’s Build System. A very convenient thing for automating your processes through CI.

A build system, despite its scary-sounding name, is just a regular program, which knows how to build other programs. As an iOS developer, you’re certainly familiar with how to build a project using Xcode. You go to the Product menu and select Build, or you use the ⌘B keyboard shortcut.

You may have also heard about Xcode Command Line Tools. It’s a set of tools which allows you to build Xcode projects directly from the terminal using the xcodebuildcommand. A very convenient thing for automating your processes, for example on your CI.
